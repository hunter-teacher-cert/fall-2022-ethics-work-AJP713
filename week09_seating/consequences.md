Goodhart's law
https://builtin.com/data-science/goodharts-law

This article is a more generic article about "Goodhart's Law" which proposes that when some specific measure is the goal of a process/algorithm then it stops becoming a good measure as people (algorithms) start to game the system.  The article is about people manipulating the system (ex. teachers changing how they teach to maximize standardize test scores) to achieve a higher rating on an evaluation but this could very well apply to computers trying to optimize an algorithm for some specific measure.

find another example where optimization of one thing has ethical ramifications and unintended consequences. bonus points if it's an ethical optimization (that is, they optimize for a good ethical reason but it has a negative unintended consequence).
