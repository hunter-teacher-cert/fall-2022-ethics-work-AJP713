Comparing Privacy Policies of Xbox(Microsoft) and Playstation(Sony) gaming platforms.  

Xbox and Playstation, operated by Microsoft and Sony respectively, have very different privacy policies.  The difference is apparent right away as Xbox does not have a seperate privacy policy for the Xbox and instead just links to Microsofts more general and all-encompassing policy. The Microsoft policy seems more geared towards lawyers. Playstation on the other hand has a very clear and laid out nicely on the website privacy policy refering to just the gaming platform.  

Both collect user data both biographical data and user behavior.  Playstation is a bit more specific about the things it collects while Microsoft's seems like they pretty much collect everything they can.  Playstation did offer some options for users to allow for less data collection about them, although these were not the default settings.  Both say the allow access for users to see what data is collected about them (this process seemed rather involved).

Both use the data to improve products and offer promotions and products.  Microsoft went into some detail about how they use AI to analyze the user's data for patterns.  Both also share data with 3rd party vendors which on xbox at least doesn't seem to be something you can opt out of.  They also share some data with other users (screen name, games played, and a few other things) and while they offer options to turn this sharing off, the default settings allow it.
